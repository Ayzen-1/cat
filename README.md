# Coffee Shop Daily Revenue Prediction Dataset

## Overview

This dataset contains daily revenue data for a coffee shop. The objective of the project is to analyze the data, understand the factors affecting the daily revenue, and create a predictive model for estimating the shop's future earnings. The dataset is a valuable resource for building machine learning models to predict business performance and understand trends.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of daily records of revenue generated by the coffee shop. It includes various features that might influence the sales, such as weather, holidays, and promotional events.

### Features:

- **Date**: The date of the record in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
- **Revenue**: The total daily revenue of the coffee shop in USD.
- **Temperature**: The average temperature for the day in Celsius.
- **Holiday**: Whether the day is a public holiday (binary: 1 for holiday, 0 for non-holiday).
- **Promotion**: Whether the shop ran a promotion on that day (binary: 1 for promotion, 0 for no promotion).
- **Weekday**: The day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.).
- **Year**: The year in which the data was recorded.
- **Month**: The month in which the data was recorded.
- **Day**: The day of the month.
  
### Example Data:

| Date       | Revenue | Temperature | Holiday | Promotion | Weekday | Year | Month | Day |
|------------|---------|-------------|---------|-----------|---------|------|-------|-----|
| 2023-01-01 | 1200    | 15          | 1       | 0         | Sunday  | 2023 | 01    | 01  |
| 2023-01-02 | 900     | 17          | 0       | 1         | Monday  | 2023 | 01    | 02  |
| 2023-01-03 | 1100    | 16          | 0       | 0         | Tuesday | 2023 | 01    | 03  |

## Objective

The goal is to use this dataset to:
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, patterns, and potential factors affecting revenue.
2. Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict daily revenue based on features such as temperature, holiday, promotion, and weekday.

## Key Insights

During the analysis, key questions to explore include:
- What are the trends in revenue over time?
- How do weather conditions affect the sales of the coffee shop?
- Does running promotions impact daily revenue?
- Are there specific weekdays where revenue is consistently higher?

## Tools and Libraries

The following libraries and tools are used for analysis and model building:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models (e.g., regression models).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and visualization.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coffee-shop-revenue-prediction.git
   cd coffee-shop-revenue-prediction
